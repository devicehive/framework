DeviceHive turns any connected device into the part of Internet of Things.
It provides the communication layer, control software and multi-platform
libraries to bootstrap development of smart energy, home automation, remote
sensing, telemetry, remote control and monitoring software and much more.

Connect embedded Linux using Python or C++ libraries and JSON protocol or
connect AVR, Microchip devices using lightweight C libraries and BINARY protocol.
Develop client applications using HTML5/JavaScript, iOS and Android libraries.
For solutions involving gateways, there is also gateway middleware that allows
to interface with devices connected to it. Leave communications to DeviceHive
and focus on actual product and innovation.
